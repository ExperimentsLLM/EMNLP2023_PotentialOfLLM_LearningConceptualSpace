# EMNLP2023_PotentialOfLLM_LearningConceptualSpace
This project proposed the use of a dataset from the taste domain for evaluating the ability of LLMs to learn perceptually grounded representations.
This repository includes the following datasets:
1. Food Database -  A total of 590 food items along six dimensions: sweet, salty, sour, bitter, umami and fat, based on the ratings that were collected by Martin et al. (2014).
2. Concept Property Pair Dataset - A total of 109K concept property pairs generated using ChatGPT.
